//! Generic run-lifetime storage substrate. Holds an address membership side-table and routes its
//! store-side lifetime-erasure through its module's single audited
//! [`erase_to_static`](super::erase_to_static) primitive — it names no workload type. A
//! [`StorageProfile`] injects its storage families via [`Stored`]; the single [`Region::alloc`]
//! engine runs the cycle gate uniformly, redirecting a self-cyclic value into the escape region
//! [`Stored::escape_target`] recovers *from the value itself* — so the frame stores no redirect
//! owner and no allocation back-edge can form. The gate is unbypassable because [`Region::storage`]
//! is private and `alloc` is the only path that reaches it — no `&Arena` ever escapes, so no `Stored`
//! impl can route a value around the redirect.
//!
//! The Koan instantiation (`KoanRegion = Region<KoanStorageProfile>`, the family `Stored` impls,
//! the cycle-gate walkers) lives in [`crate::machine::core::arena`]. See
//! [memory-model.md § Arena lifetime erasure](../../design/memory-model.md#region-lifetime-erasure)
//! for the lifetime-erasure soundness argument and
//! [per-call-region/lifecycle.md § Cycle gate](../../design/per-call-region/lifecycle.md#cycle-gate-on-alloc_object)
//! for the redirect `alloc` enforces.
