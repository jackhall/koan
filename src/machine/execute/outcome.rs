//! The unified scheduler-step currency.
//!
//! Every node step — a fresh dispatch decide, a finish, a builtin body, an invoke — decides
//! against a read-only [`SchedulerView`](super::dispatch::SchedulerView) and **returns** an
//! [`Outcome`]; [`KoanRuntime::apply_outcome`](super::runtime::KoanRuntime) is the sole place that
//! turns an outcome into the scheduler-graph writes it implies and the terminal
//! [`NodeStep`](super::nodes::NodeStep). The scheduler never learns *what* a step ran (dispatch /
//! invoke / builtin) nor *whether* it ran before — only a read view in and an outcome out.
//!
//! The taxonomy is AST-free — no variant names a `KFunction` or a `KExpression`:
//! - [`Outcome::Done`] — the node dies, producing a value to lift or an error.
//! - [`Outcome::Continue`] — the node lives; replace its work and run again immediately (no park).
//!   A resolved call folds into this: the producer installs the per-call cart (its frame placement)
//!   and the work re-decides via the folded `invoke` / re-resolve closure on the next pop — so the
//!   dispatch→execution hand-off is a dep-free `Continue`, not a distinct trigger.
//! - [`Outcome::ParkThenContinue`] — park on deps; on resolve run a [`Continuation`] that yields
//!   another outcome.
//! - [`Outcome::Forward`] — splice the slot out as an alias of an existing producer.
