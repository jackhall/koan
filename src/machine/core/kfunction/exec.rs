//! The innermost layer of the body executor — pure koan semantics, no scheduler task format, no
//! lifting.
//!
//! `exec` runs a body in its per-call frame and describes — in its *native* terms
//! ([`KExpression`], [`Carried`]) — what should happen next, as an [`ExecOutcome`]: it failed, it
//! produced a (still-unlifted) value, it tail-calls after some leading statements, or it suspends
//! awaiting some sub-expressions. It names *expressions to dispatch* and a *continuation* — never a
//! scheduler step, never the scheduler itself.
//!
//! The scheduler-aware shell that maps an [`ExecOutcome`] onto the scheduler is
//! `execute::dispatch::exec::invoke`: it reuses the live dispatcher's resolution, turns the outcome
//! into a `BodyResult` (`Tail → tail_with_frame`, …), and lets the scheduler lift any produced
//! value at the done boundary. Keeping that out of here is what lets `exec` stay scheduler-agnostic
//! and `'run`-free.
//!
//! ## Two lifetimes
//!
//! [`ExecOutcome`] carries two, because the AST and the produced value genuinely differ: the
//! dispatchable expressions are **borrowed** from the long-lived, immutable AST (`'ast`, which
//! outlives the run), while a produced value lives in the call frame (`'frame`, which dies with
//! the call). `KExpression`'s invariance blocks collapsing them. `exec` holds no lift handle, so
//! it cannot move the value out of the frame; the scheduler lifts it at the done boundary.
