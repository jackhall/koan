//! Lexical binding façade: co-mutating `RefCell` maps (`types`, `data`,
//! `functions`, `placeholders`, `pending_overloads`) behind validated write
//! paths that keep the function-mirror invariant — every `data[name]` wrapping
//! a `KFunction` lives in `functions[signature.untyped_key()]`. Nominal type
//! declarations (NEWTYPE / UNION / SIG) install their identity into `types`
//! only — there is no value-side carrier; a module is a value and binds into
//! `data`. The `data` and `types` maps
//! are a structural partition: a name is committed to one xor the other, never
//! both, enforced by the cross-kind check the value and type write paths run.
//!
//! Borrow discipline across the maps: `types → functions → data`.
//!
//! Every entry carries a [`BindingIndex`] naming its installing statement's lexical
//! position, gated by the strict cutoff `idx < c`, so a forward reference (a
//! later-positioned binding) is invisible — type binders included. A type entry pairs
//! that index with its installing [`NodeHandle`] in a [`DeclarationSite`]: the handle
//! alone answers the same-declaration question, and the index there does visibility
//! only. `idx == 0` is the
//! first position: FN parameters and MATCH/TRY `it` sit there, and the builtins are
//! registered there in the immutable run-global root. The builtins stay reachable
//! because that root is off the lexical chain (its cutoff is `None`, so every entry in
//! it is visible) and is consulted in one hop through each scope's direct root
//! reference — not through an `idx == 0`-always-visible carve-out. The `idx == 0` tag
//! is what [`Bindings::has_builtin_type`] / [`Bindings::has_builtin_function`] read to
//! mark a genuine builtin for the no-shadow and root-first consults. The operator
//! registry takes no such consult: its walk is innermost-wins, so the root's builtin
//! groups are found last and act as defaults (see
//! [`crate::machine::core::Scope::resolve_operator_group_with_chain`]).
//!
//! Production reads use the visibility-aware [`Bindings::lookup_value`] /
//! [`Bindings::lookup_type`] / [`Bindings::lookup_function`], passing a
//! `chain_cutoff` computed via [`crate::machine::core::LexicalFrame::index_for`].
//! Raw map accessors are `#[cfg(test)]`.
