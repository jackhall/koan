//! `Witnessed<T, W>` and the lifetime-erasure substrate it is built on — the single audited owner
//! of the erase-to-`'static` / reattach-to-`'r` discipline every lifetime-free inter-node carrier
//! shares. It sits below both [`machine`](crate::machine) and [`scheduler`](crate::scheduler) and
//! names no concrete workload type, so each depends on it for the machinery, not the reverse.
//!
//! A node's slot stores a borrow-carrying value the borrow checker can't lifetime-track: it forgets
//! the borrow's lifetime to `'static` for storage and re-anchors it at a caller-chosen lifetime on
//! read. The re-anchor is sound only while a *liveness witness* — the producer frame `Rc` that pins
//! the pointee — is held. [`Witnessed<T, W>`] bundles the erased value with that witness `W` in one
//! value, so "the witness keeps the value alive" is a type invariant, not a comment. Its accessors
//! are rank-2 (`for<'b>`) branded so a fabricated content lifetime cannot escape the witness pin:
//! [`Witnessed::with`] (borrow + read) and [`Witnessed::map`] (consume + transform) re-anchor an
//! already-bundled carrier, [`Witnessed::yoke`] *sources* one from the witness's own region so
//! co-location holds by construction, and [`Witnessed::merge`] combines two under one brand and
//! re-seals under the witness that pins both. For storage *between* accesses a carrier rests in a
//! [`Sealed`], the opaque dormant form that hides every transform and re-anchors only through the
//! rank-2 [`Sealed::open`].
//!
//! The layout machinery underneath — the [`Reattachable`] family contract, the private [`retype`]
//! primitive, [`erase_to_static`] and the storable [`Erased<T>`] — is the same single-lifetime
//! retype every carrier family routes. The carrier families ([`Reattachable`] impls) live in the
//! workload beside their own types, so this module stays workload-independent.
