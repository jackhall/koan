# Module system stage 5 — Modular implicits

**Problem.** Stages 1-2 give an explicit module language: every functor
application, every module-typed argument, every signature constraint is
written by hand. For everyday generic code this is verbose. The
[`KType::Module`](../src/runtime/model/types/ktype.rs) slot kind that stage 1
shipped accepts any module value regardless of which signature it satisfies,
so even the explicit-module path lacks the signature-bound dispatch a
generic-function call site needs. Stage 5 introduces **implicit module
parameters**: a function declares that it requires some module satisfying a
given signature, and at the call site the compiler resolves which module to
thread in by searching scope. This is the ergonomic payoff of the design.

**Impact.**

- *Concise generic code.* `sort(xs)` and `MakeSet()` replace
  `sort(IntOrd, xs)` and `MakeSet(IntOrd)`. The compiler resolves which
  module to thread in by searching scope, so call sites stop carrying the
  dictionary by hand.
- *Natural standard-library shape.* `sort`, `min`, `intersect`, `==` take
  their dictionary of operations implicitly and ship as ordinary generic
  Koan code rather than as verbose explicit-module functions or builtins.
- *Multi-parameter dispatch.* Binary operators (`+`, `==`, `intersect`) and other
  multi-type predicates dispatch natively — a multi-type implicit signature
  dispatches on all of its abstract types simultaneously rather than needing a
  partial-order tiebreak between single-type candidates.

**Directions.**

- *Signature-bound module-typed dispatch — decided.* The substrate the
  implicit-parameter machinery rides on: `KType::Module` slots learn to
  carry a required signature, and the dispatcher checks that the bound
  module value satisfies it. Implicit parameters are then a special case
  of a typed module slot whose argument is resolved by search rather than
  supplied at the call site. Stage 1 shipped the unconstrained
  `KType::Module` slot; this stage tightens it.
- *Implicit-parameter declaration syntax — open.* The function signature
  needs a slot for implicit module parameters; surface form follows stage
  1's conventions but the exact spelling is unsettled.
- *Explicit-application disambiguation syntax — deferred.* Surface form is
  deliberately deferred to [stage 7](module-system-7-syntax-tuning.md);
  this stage ships a placeholder, and stage 7 designs the user-facing form
  against patterns from real code. The placeholder is intentionally ugly
  so it doesn't accidentally become the final answer.
- *Resolution algorithm — decided per [design/module-system.md § Resolution and coherence](../design/module-system.md#resolution-and-coherence-the-design-dials).*
  Lexical scope plus explicitly imported implicits; filter by signature
  unification; pick the most specific; ambiguity is an error. Specificity
  rule: most-specific-wins, with unrelated ties as errors.
- *Inference and search interleaving — decided per [design/module-system.md § Inference and search](../design/module-system.md#inference-and-search-as-scheduler-work).*
  Implicit search lands as a single `SEARCH_IMPLICIT` builtin — no new
  node kind, no parallel substitution table. Inference produces type
  refinements that search consumes; search produces module choices that
  refine types other inference tasks are waiting on. Both ride the
  existing `Dispatch` / `Bind` machinery stage 2 lands.
- *Higher-order restriction — decided.* Implicit modules cannot themselves
  take implicit parameters; documented and enforced in this stage. This is
  the architectural simplification that keeps resolution decidable and
  search-tree size bounded.
- *Error message investment — decided.* When ambiguity errors fire, they
  name the candidate modules with their import paths and suggest the
  explicit form. The design doc identifies this as where
  strict-on-ambiguity lives or dies for users.
- *Orphan-rule lint — decided.* Implicits not defined alongside their
  signature or any of their dispatched types produce a warning, not an
  error — a lint signaling likely coherence issues without forbidding the
  third-party extension pattern.

## Dependencies

**Requires:**
- [Stage 2 — Module values and functors through the scheduler](module-system-2-scheduler.md) —
  modular implicits ride on the dispatch and execution of module values
  that stage 2 lands, and on the type-builtin substrate stage 2 wires
  end-to-end through FN signatures.

**Unblocks:**
- [Stage 6 — Equivalence-checked coherence](module-system-6-equivalence-checking.md)
- [Stage 7 — Syntax tuning and witness types](module-system-7-syntax-tuning.md)
- [Group-based operators](group-based-operators.md)
- [Static type checking and JIT compilation](static-typing-and-jit.md)

Stage 4 (axioms) is not a hard prerequisite — modular implicits can ship
without axiom checking — but the cross-implicit equivalence story (stage 6)
combines them.
